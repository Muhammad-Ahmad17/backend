## 🛡️ Security Features

1. **Password Hashing**
   - Passwords hashed with SHA-256
   - Never stored in plain text

2. **Basic Authentication**
   - Uses HTTP Basic Auth header
   - Token format: Base64 encoded `username:password`

3. **Client-Side Protection**
   - Token stored in localStorage
   - Session validation on page load
   - Auto-redirect to login when unauthorized

4. **Server-Side Protection**
   - All management endpoints require authentication
   - 401 Unauthorized response for invalid/missing credentials

---

## 🔄 Authentication Flow

1. **Login Process:**
   ```
   User visits /login → Enters credentials → POST /api/login → 
   Token returned → Stored in localStorage → Redirect to /dashboard
   ```

2. **Accessing Dashboard:**
   ```
   Visit /dashboard → Check localStorage for token → 
   Validate token via /api/validate-session → 
   If valid: Load dashboard | If invalid: Redirect to /login
   ```

3. **API Requests:**
   ```
   All API calls include: Authorization: Basic {token}
   Backend validates token → If valid: Process request | If invalid: 401 error
   ```

4. **Logout:**
   ```
   Click logout button → Remove token from localStorage → Redirect to /login
   ```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Login (Success):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"prismaticsport","password":"Dive9852&aPRISMATIC"}'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Authentication successful",
  "token": "cHJpc21hdGljc3BvcnQ6RGl2ZTk4NTImYVBSSVNNQVRJQw=="
}
```

### Test Login (Failure):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"wrong","password":"wrong"}'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Invalid username or password"
}
```

### Test Protected Endpoint (Without Auth):
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/products-json
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Authentication required",
  "error": "Missing or invalid authorization header"
}
```

### Test Protected Endpoint (With Auth):
```bash
TOKEN="cHJpc21hdGljc3BvcnQ6RGl2ZTk4NTImYVBSSVNNQVRJQw=="
curl http://localhost:5000/api/products-json \
  -H "Authorization: Basic $TOKEN"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "count": X,
  "products": [...]
}
```

## 📋 Protected Endpoints

All the following endpoints now require authentication:

- ✅ `POST /api/create-product`
- ✅ `GET /api/products-json`
- ✅ `GET /api/products/category/:category`
- ✅ `GET /api/products/category/:category/manage`
- ✅ `PUT /api/products/category/:category/:id`
- ✅ `DELETE /api/products/category/:category/:id`
- ✅ `GET /api/categories/summary`
- ✅ `GET /api/subcategories/:category`

## 🌐 Public Endpoints

These remain public (no authentication required):

- 📂 `GET /` - Home page
- 🔓 `GET /login` - Login page
- 📊 `GET /api/categories` - Categories list
- 📊 `GET /api/categories-structure` - Categories structure
- 🔐 `POST /api/login` - Login endpoint
- 🔐 `POST /api/validate-session` - Session validation

---

## 🎯 Usage Instructions

1. **First Time Access:**
   - Navigate to: `http://localhost:5000/dashboard`
   - You'll be redirected to: `http://localhost:5000/login`
   - Enter credentials:
     - Username: `prismaticsport`
     - Password: `Dive9852&aPRISMATIC`
   - Click "Sign In"
   - You'll be redirected to the dashboard

2. **Subsequent Access:**
   - If you haven't logged out, you'll stay logged in
   - Token is stored in browser localStorage
   - No need to login again until you logout or clear browser data

3. **Logout:**
   - Click the "🔓 Logout" button in the top-right corner of the dashboard
   - You'll be redirected to the login page
   - Token will be removed from localStorage

## 🔧 Maintenance

### To Change Credentials:

1. Open `middleware/auth.js`
2. Update the CREDENTIALS object:
   ```javascript
   const CREDENTIALS = {
       username: 'new-username',
       passwordHash: crypto.createHash('sha256').update('new-password').digest('hex')
   };
   ```
3. Update the hardcoded password hash in `routes/auth.js` (validateSession function)
4. Restart the server

### To Add More Users:

Current implementation supports only one user. To add multiple users:
1. Convert CREDENTIALS object to an array
2. Modify validation logic to loop through users
3. Consider adding a simple user management system

## ✅ Security Checklist

- [x] Passwords are hashed (SHA-256)
- [x] No plain text passwords in code
- [x] All management endpoints protected
- [x] Client-side session validation
- [x] Auto-redirect on unauthorized access
- [x] Logout functionality implemented
- [x] Token-based authentication
- [x] Basic Auth header validation

---

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

When deploying to production:

1. **Environment Variables:**
   - Consider moving credentials to environment variables
   - Use stronger hashing (bcrypt) instead of SHA-256

2. **HTTPS:**
   - Basic Auth sends credentials in Base64 (not encrypted)
   - Always use HTTPS in production to encrypt traffic

3. **Token Expiry:**
   - Current implementation doesn't expire tokens
   - Consider adding JWT with expiration for production

4. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Add rate limiting to login endpoint to prevent brute force attacks

✅ Firefox (Latest)  
✅ Safari (Latest)  
✅ All modern browsers with localStorage support
